Verizon EWA Hold off</font><br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Verizon workers in nine states could walk off the job as soon as early Sunday if union negotiators don't reach an agreement over benefits with the wireless carrier.
A contract covering 39,000 Verizon workers represented by two unions expires at the end of Saturday. Last week, the Communications Workers of America announced that 86 percent of Verizon workers covered by the contract voted to strike in a recent poll, if a new agreement isn't reached.
The contract covers employees in nine states from Massachusetts to Virginia who work for Verizon's wireline business, which provides fixed-line phone services and FiOS Internet service.

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>June 30, 2015<br>
 Eearlier this week by introducing by-the-minute billing for virtual-server instances in its Windows Azure cloud (several weeks after Google announced the same thing) and luring members of its developer community MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) with monthly credit for Azure use.
 Both Google and Microsoft explained the switch to by-the-minute billing from an hourly rate by the fact that developers often do not need to spin up a VM for an entire hour. Microsoft took it a step further than Google, offering no minimum-use commitment (Google requires a minimum of 10 minutes).
